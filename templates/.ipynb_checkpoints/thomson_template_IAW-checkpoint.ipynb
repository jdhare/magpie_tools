    "First, you need to provide raw data in the form of a .asc file (plain ASCII, tab delimited) exported by Andor Solis for both the high power background and the shot. The background is used to calibrate the fibres. You can provide as many background files as you wish - the raw images are summed together. This is especially useful if you have pin scattering measurements for individual fibres, as the signal to noise ratio is far better than the high power background where the light scatters off particles in the vacuum chamber. To create a Thomson Scattering Analysis object, we use:\n",

To fix this, there is an interpolation subroutine which performs the convolution on a higher resolution model before comparing with data. In `f.fit_fibre()`, change the value of `interpolation_scale` to increase the number of points (10 is 10 times the number of points). This will dramatically slow down the code, but give more accurate answers. This should also give higher accuracy when trying to fit asymetric functions (where V_fe is not 0).\n",
